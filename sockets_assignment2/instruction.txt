Part A: Write a program to connect to port 80 on nigelward.com; request the index.html file, and report the value of bytes 1012 through 1028.

Part B: Python is only willing to send bytes via sockets, so if I want
to send the number 256, for example, I have to do something on the
server side, like str(256) + '\n' and then on the client side
something like int(whatWasReceived).  Some people prefer to do
(256).to_bytes(2, byteorder=big) on the server side, and on the
client side do int.from_bytes(received, byteorder=big).  

a) Modify server-demo.py and your client to see if you can really send numbers this way.  

b) Show what happens if one side instead uses byteorder=small.

c) Read the python sockets page description of htons() and ntons() and experiment with them to determine whether the machine you are using is big-endian or little-endian.

Part C: Reimplement your chatbot from Assignment 1 as a client-server
system.  The front end (the client) should interact with the user, the
back end (the server) should handle the response logic, and the two
should communicate via sockets, using protocol of your own design.

Submit a report including all code, illustrative outputs, and your conclusion for B.

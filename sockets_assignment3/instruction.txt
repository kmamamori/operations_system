Sockets 3 : Find a partner.  Working together, test their chatbot
client with your chatbot server.  If it doesn't work, document the
problem and fix it. It it does work, test their server with your
client, and document and fix any problems.  Together write a report,
including a description of the main problem and how you fixed it, plus
evidence that in the end you got the client and server to work together.  

If this is not exactly possible (perhaps your partner didn't get their code
running, or you and your partner used the exact same protocol),
instead do the assignment using one of the exemplar clients or servers
provided above.

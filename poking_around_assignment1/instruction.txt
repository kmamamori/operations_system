Poking Around, Part 1
Do this from your laptop or desktop; ideally with a wired connection.
These commands may require installing cygwin or more cygwin commands.
If you don't have a wired connection, try to investigate anyway.
If you have a hotspot or some other situation, you can do this with a wired friend.
In the worst case, just learn about these commands and write a 1-page report on them.
a) What is your machine's MAC address?  Hint: getmac
b) What is your machine's IP address?  Hint: ipconfig
c1, c2) How many machines do you think will be listed in your desktop/laptop's
IPv4 routing table? How many are there really?  Hint: netstat -r
d) Can you reach all of the machines listed in your routing table?  Try
pinging them.
e1, e2) How many hops does it take to reach utep.edu from your desktop/laptop?
Try tracert.  Is the path always the same?

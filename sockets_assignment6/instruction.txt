threadedServer.py is a multithreaded server that can handle
multiple clients at once, keeping a cumulative count of per-thread
responses and total responses.  Unfortunately sometimes the total
response count gets messed up.  Diagnose the problem and fix it.  Do
not change, move, or delete any existing lines of code; you may only
add new code.  The only system calls you may add are those in the
_thread or Threading modules.  In your report, include evidence that
your modifications solve the problem. (est 1 hour)
